  <h1 id="thirdcontent"> Taekwondo </h1>

    <h2> What is Taekwondo? </h2>
<p>
 Taekwondo is one of the most systematic and scientific Korean traditional
 martial arts, that teaches more than physical fighting skills. It is a 
 discipline that shows ways of enhancing our spirit and life through training 
 our body and mind. Today, it has become a global sport that has gained an 
 international reputation, and stands among the official games in the Olympics. 
 Taekwondo was developed in post World War 2 Korea by various martial artists
 but is usually attributed to military general and martial artist Choi Hong Hi.
 this martial art is based on the native Korean martial arts of Taekkyeon, Subak
 and Gwonbeop but also has significant elements of other martial arts such as Japanese
 Karate and to a lesser extent Chinese Kung Fu.
</p>

Taekwondo have been a major part of the Olympic Games since 1988.
