Haarlem is a city and municipality in the Netherlands and the capital of the province of North Holland . 
The city lies on the River Spaarne and in the South Kennemerland region.
Haarlem with its many historic buildings and beautiful old squares lies near the beach on the banks of the Spaarne river.
It is wonderful to stroll through the narrow streets lined by the monumental buildings built by master Lieven de Key. 
Visit extraordinary museums, such as the Frans Hals or Teylers Museum, and explore its countless cafés and restaurants.
Haarlem is called the most Flemish city of the north with reason! Originally known for its flower growing district, 
Haarlem in the beginning was also known for its textiles, shipyards, engineering plants and textile mills. In 1573,
 the Spanish ended its charter. Then, in the 16th and 17th centuries, Haarlem became known as a mecca for dutch painting.</p>

    <h1 id="thirdcontent"> Taekwondo </h1>

    <h2> What is Taekwondo? </h2>


<article class="about">
<p>
 Taekwondo is one of the most systematic and scientific Korean traditional
 martial arts, that teaches more than physical fighting skills. It is a 
 discipline that shows ways of enhancing our spirit and life through training 
 our body and mind. Today, it has become a global sport that has gained an 
 international reputation, and stands among the official games in the Olympics. 
 Taekwondo was developed in post World War 2 Korea by various martial artists
 but is usually attributed to military general and martial artist Choi Hong Hi.
 this martial art is based on the native Korean martial arts of Taekkyeon, Subak
 and Gwonbeop but also has significant elements of other martial arts such as Japanese
 Karate and to a lesser extent Chinese Kung Fu.

Taekwondo have been a major part of the Olympic Games since 1988.
